# 1. Combining Vectors:
# http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/vector/combining-vectors
# Vectors can be combined via the function c. For examples, the following two vectors n and s are combined into a new vector containing elements from both vectors.
n= c(2, 3, 5) 
s= c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee") 
combined=c(s,  n)

# 7. ACCESSING VECTOR ELEMENTS
## Sub-setting

# Accessing vector elements using multiple position
t <- c("Sun","Mon","Tue","Wed","Thurs","Fri","Sat")

# Accessing vector elements using logical indexing
v<- t[c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)] 
print(v)

# Accessing vector elements using 0/1 indexing.
y <- t[c(1,0,0,0,0,0,7)]
print(y)

# subset by sequence (: operator)

# 8. VECTOR MANUPULATION
v1 <- c(3,8,4,5,0,11)

# Vector Addition

# Vector Division 
divi.result<-v1/v2 
print(divi.result)



# 9.  VECTOR RECYCLING
# If two vector are unequal in length, then shorter vector will recycle to match the longer vector, here below the shorter vector is v2, and it recycle two time to match the longer cycle. 
v1<- c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

# 11. Vector Arithmetic 
# For example, suppose we have two vectors a and b.
a = c (2, 3, 4, 5, 7)
b = c (4, 7, 8, 9, 10)
# We can multiply a and b vector with 5
5 * a
5 * b
# We can sum this two vector together
a + b
# we can subtraction, multiplication and division of these two vector
a - b
a * b
a / b



# 12. Name Vector Members 
# We can assign names to vector members. For example, the following variable v is a character string vector with two members.
v <- c("Mary", "Nishi")
names(v)= c("First", "Last")
v["First"]
v["Last"]
v[c("Last", "First")]



# 13. Making a vector filled with values
# 1 will be repeated 50 times
rep(1, 50)
# 3 will be repeated 10 times
rep(3, 10)
# False will be output and for 50 times
rep(F, 50)
# 1 to 5 will be repeated for 4 times
rep(1:5, 4)

rep(1:5, each=4)
# Use it on a factor
rep(factor(LETTERS[1:3]), 5)



# 14. Vector Types Conversion or Data type conversion
# Treating strings as factors or characters.
# By default, strings  the data are converted to factors. If you load the data below with read.csv, then all the text columns will be treated as factors, even though it might make more sense to treat some of them as strings. If you don't want your data to be treated as factor instead of string then use the following command.
data <- read.csv("new_file.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# You might have to convert some columns to factors
data$country <- factor(data$country)
class(data$country)
