# Select elements from a data frame with the help of square brackets [ ]. By using a comma, you can indicate what to select from the rows and the columns respectively. 
# For example:
my_df[1,2] # selects the value at the first row and second column in my_df DATAFRAME.
my_df[1:3,2:4] # selects rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4 in my_df DATAFRAME
my_df[1, ] #selects all elements of the first row
my_df[, 1] # Select all elements in the first column

# Sometimes you have many variables and difficult to find out the numbers of columns, in this case name of the variable is the best option
my_df[1:5, "type"] # Select first five rows and type column 


# How to Sort or Order element in a data frame? 
# In data analysis you can sort your data according to a certain variable in the dataset. In R, this is done with the help of the function order().
# order() is a function that gives you the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable, such as a vector for example:
a <- c(100, 10, 1000)
order(a)
a[order(a)]
